# Kafka Pipelining

Welcome to the End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline project utilizing Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, Apache Spark, and Cassandra. This comprehensive guide will walk you through building a robust data pipeline from data ingestion to processing and storage. Everything is containerized using Docker for ease of deployment and scalability.

## System Design

![System Architecture](https://github.com/theFutureGuy/kafka/Data%20engineering%20architecture.png)

**Explanation**: This section provides an overview of the project's architecture, highlighting the key components involved in the data engineering pipeline. The diagram illustrates how data flows through various stages of the pipeline, from ingestion to storage.

The project architecture consists of the following components:

- **Data Source**: Utilizes the `randomuser.me` API to generate random user data.
- **Apache Airflow**: Orchestrates the pipeline and stores fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Facilitates streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Aids in monitoring and schema management of Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: Used for data processing with master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Stores the processed data.



**Explanation**: 

By working on this project,

- Setting up a data pipeline with Apache Airflow
- Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka
- Distributed synchronization with Apache Zookeeper
- Data processing techniques with Apache Spark
- Data storage solutions with Cassandra and PostgreSQL
- Containerizing your entire data engineering setup with Docker
